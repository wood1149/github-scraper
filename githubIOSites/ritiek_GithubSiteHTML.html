      <div class="entry">
        <p>Everything said in this post is based on my half-understanding of how memory works,
especially in Linux. There are certainly going to be parts in this post that are misunderstood
by me. Don’t rely on this post for your homework and take everything in this post with a
grain of salt. However, I hope to continue to refine the content in this post as I understand
more about how a computer works. Consider this as a disclaimer. That said, let’s begin!</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In my university, we mostly have only-Windows computers. What I mean by “only-windows computers” that the computers
have Windows as the only operating system installed on them. Now, I always like to be accompanied by a terminal
with everything I do (even writing this post in a TUI on Linux) and avoid proprietary software whenever possible.
By the way, <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder">cmder</a> is a pretty good project that adds the missing flakes (like
wget, curl, etc.) to the command-prompt but it doesn’t change the fact that Windows itself is still closed-source
(atleast as of writing this). Me, being an avid supporter of open-source cannot back down here.</p>

mostly stopping me from doing same stuff on two different machines at the same time without huge latency issues,

MIDI keyboard (Yamaha P-45 Digital Piano) so that I can receive and send MIDI events to my Linux machine

      <div class="entry">
        <p>My christmas holidays have just begun and I’ve been trying to play some media files on Kodi.
This blog post is mainly a result of frustruation where some media files just won’t play on two of my
low-cost computing devices (Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and Amazon Fire TV Stick) and in hope that this blog post will be
a good partner to me if someday I in the future decide to tinker further.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>With my now four-year old Pi 2, I’ve noticed a static spark-like noise coming out from the 3.5mm audio
jack for as far as I can remember. This noise wasn’t the kind of usual constant white noise buzzing from
the speakers. Instead, my connected speakers would make a crackle noise at regular intervals and then
remain perfectly noise-less for the remaining period. This periodic noise only appeared when the speakers
were connected to the Pi and didn’t happen with any other device.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>During this period, nothing big happened except we’re able to get merge a new
Plasma subclass supposed to work with OpenPMD Datasets
<a href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/500">#500</a>! It still isn’t
very efficient to work with larger datasets and should rather be considered a
prototype at the moment. It currently supports reading only mesh data from an
HDF5. It also reads the complete record into memory, which is certain to cause
problems with big datasets. In the real world, heavy datasets can go into dozens
of GBs. In the future, we’re going to have to provide a way to read stuff
directly from disk or provide someother way instead writing all of it to memory.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>We’re currently working on developing a new Plasma subclass. It is supposed to read
HDF5 files that are based on OpenPMD standard and we have a sort of prototype ready
in <a href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/500">#500</a>. It should be ready to
merge once we figure out how we are supposed to handle the example datasets for our
tests. It probably isn’t a good idea to ship them with the main PlasmaPy codebase.
I guess we’re going to settle downloading them on the fly when running our tests.</p>
